<strong>Quantum Machine Learning: Benchmark and Application</strong>
<br>
Quantum machine learning (QML) is an active research area exploring quantum-enhanced solutions for real-world problems. While quantum advantages have shown promise, they remain difficult to generalize, particularly in ML. A key foundation for demonstrating such advantages is the theory of quantum kernels. In this talk, I cover a detailed analysis of the quantum kernel approach, leveraging feature maps and relevant hyperparameters to develop quantum-enhanced ML models. This included presenting a novel high-order feature map and a comparative evaluation of distinct SOTA feature maps on distinct benchmark datasets for classification tasks. Additionally, the importance of hyperparameter tuning is emphasized, as it improves performance by capturing complex data patterns and enabling superior decision boundaries. Furthermore, the designed QML model is extended to brain data analysis. I introduce SNN-QC, a novel hybrid computational framework combining neuro-inspired information processing using SNNs and quantum kernels for quantum information processing. SNN-QC, as proof of concept, is demonstrated on a smaller EEG dataset to classify wrist movement tasks, emphasising the advantages of the proposed feature map. SNN-QC applicability is demonstrated on quantum hardware using both a superconducting IBM QPU and a high-fidelity noisy simulation, along with a noise analysis. The results show that SNN-QC, as a proof of concept, provides a potential pathway toward developing quantum-enhanced models for a broader class of spatio-temporal problems.

<strong>Health Monitoring and Drift Detection of Cryogenic Pumps for Smart Semiconductor Manufacturing</strong>
<br>
Semiconductor manufacturing involves several critical steps, wherein maintaining an ultra-high vacuum is essential. In industry, this environment is typically achieved using cryogenic pumps. Due to operational loads and material aging, the health of pumps starts deteriorating over time. A sudden vacuum malfunction can lead to processing chamber contamination and disrupt production. However, a prognostics and health management (PHM) framework can be utilized to enhance system safety and reliability through continuous health monitoring, drift detection and accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL). For health degradation or drift detection, densities of reference and test windows are calculated to find dissimilarity score using direct density ratio estimation (DDRE). Moreover, DDRE-based change score is used for distinguishing steady drift and progressive or runway failure. Additionally, to validate the effectiveness of the DDRE algorithm, experiments have been conducted using publicly available rolling bearing datasets.

<em>I'm a systems neuroscientist who uses a behaviour-first approach to understand how the brain can learn from and exploit complex, changing environments. I believe that the study of naturalistic behaviours such as foraging can allow greater insight into the neural mechanisms that have evolved to support flexible higher order cognitive processes such as decision-making, planning, and memory. As part of this interest I co-organise an online seminar series, the <a href="https://future-of-foraging-seminars.github.io/">Future of Foraging</a>.

I'm currently a Research Scientist in the Dudman lab at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus in Virginia. In my current research I'm using fibre photometry to record dopamine in the striatum as naive mice learn about many changing options in a large arena. Before moving to the U.S., I completed a D.Phil. in the Walton and Husain labs at the University of Oxford. During my D.Phil. I trained rats to make or withhold movement to understand the relationship between ventral striatal dopamine release and motivated action.</em><br>
