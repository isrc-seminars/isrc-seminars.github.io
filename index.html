<em>Vimal Dwivedi earned his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://taltech.ee/en/">Tallinn University of Technology</a>, Tallinn, Estonia, in May 2022, with a project sponsored by the <a href="https://www.qtum.org/">Qtum Foundation</a>, Singapore. During his doctoral research, he developed a smart contract language (See his <a href="https://doi.org/10.23658/taltech.14/2022">Ph.D. thesis</a>) aimed at facilitating the development of error-free blockchain applications. Currently, he holds a position as a Lecturer in Data Analytics at Ulster University. Before this role, he was lecturer in Computer Science at Teesside University, England and prior to this role, he contributed as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science (EEECS) at Queen's University Belfast (QUB), Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. There, he worked on a project titled "Digital Twin and Blockchain for Business Decision Modeling" in <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/arc/">ARC research group</a> with the collaboration with PwC Belfast, Northern Ireland. His research interest includes Blockchain Systems, Digital Identity, Web 3.0, Digital Twins.</em><br><br>

<strong>Utilising blockchain and digital twin for supply chain resiliency</strong>
<br>
In today's dynamic and interconnected global economy, supply chain resilience is paramount to ensuring continuity and mitigating disruptions. This talk explores the innovative integration of blockchain technology and digital twin models to enhance supply chain resilience. Blockchain provides a decentralized and immutable ledger that ensures transparency, traceability, and security across all supply chain processes, while digital twins offer real-time, virtual representations of physical assets, enabling predictive analytics and scenario planning. By combining these technologies, organisations can achieve a more responsive and adaptive supply chain, capable of withstanding disruptions and optimising performance. The talk outlines the key benefits of this integration, including enhanced visibility, improved risk management, and greater operational efficiency, and discusses potential challenges and future directions for research in this evolving field. Through case studies and simulations, this talk demonstrate the practical applications and value of utilizing blockchain and digital twin technologies in creating a resilient supply chain infrastructure.</p>
