 <strong>Title: </strong> Implicit brain-machine interactions in navigation and target identification tasks.
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>  There is a performance bottleneck in many brain-computer interfaces, as users are required to control each low-level action in order to achieve a high-level goal. For example, users may need to consciously generate brain signals to move a cursor, prosthesis, or assistive robot, step-by-step to a desired location. This places a high mental workload on the user. Recent studies have shown the possibility of using "cognitive probing" to reduce the mental burden of current BCIs. This is achieved by monitoring brain signals generated spontaneously while users merely observe the machine's actions, and using these signals as feedback to help the machine perform the desired task. These studies have mostly been based on distinguishing correct actions from erroneous ones, by detecting error-related potentials. In this talk we will discuss the possibility of obtaining more detailed information from passive brain signals than simply whether an action was correct or erroneous. Bringing these advances together, we will present the foundation of a new frame-work for detailed implicit communication between brain and machine, by embedding the real-time EEG classification outputs in a dynamic probabilistic model of the most likely target loci based on the previous actions of the robot. This facilitates semi-autonomous robot control, through a more efficient and user-friendly brain-
machine interaction.</p>

 <strong>Title: </strong> Augmenting Decision-making capabilities using Brain-Computer Interfacing Technology.
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Billions of decisions are made every day in the world. Many of these decisions, particularly in the armed forces, are critical, making a mistake resulting in extremely adverse outcomes, including loss of lives. Groups typically can make better decisions than individuals. However, in some circumstances (e.g., in the presence of a strong leader), communication between members can have a detrimental effect on decision quality. Neural signals have been reported to be related to decision-making processes and it is shown to negate the effects of communication bias in decisions. However, brain signals, especially one recorded using Electroencephalography (EEG), are extremely noisy, which makes it very hard to reliably provide information on (or aid) individual decisions. Nonetheless, it is plausible to think that collective decisions could be aided and enhanced by integrating decisions and their neural correlates across the members of a group.
In this talk, Dr Saugat Bhattacharyya will give an overview of how group decision-making aided by collaborative Brain Computer Interfaces (cBCIs) is better than traditional means of making group decisions and how it may be suited for circumstances where decisions are based on a rapid and accurate assessment of the environment and where fast reactions are needed. This talk will cover the journey and achievements of cBCIs supported decision support system over the last few years and will briefly introduce concepts on teaming humans with machines (virtual humans) to augment critical decision-making by building trust and co-operation between the two entities.</p>

 <strong>Title: </strong> Trustworthy AI for medical and health research.
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly being deployed in society, it is critical to ensure that these systems are trustworthy, in particular in high-stake real-world applications, such as the medical and health domains. There has been growing interest to develop and deploy AI models and algorithms that are not only accurate, but also interpretable/explainable, fair, privacy-preserving, causal, and robust. This talk will focus on frontier research in this timely, trending, and important cross-disciplinary research domain, and provide an overview to cutting-edge knowledge, technology, and findings.</p>
