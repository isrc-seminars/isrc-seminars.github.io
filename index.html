<em>I am a PostDoctoral researcher in the group of Melanie Stefan at Medical School Berlin working on computational models of synaptic plasticity. My research interest is focused on the biological processes of learning. I hope to elucidate the role of temporal-spatial signalling of the various actors within the plasticity cascades in health and disease. My approach uses multi-scale models including biochemical reaction system and electrophysiology in order to translate the highly detailed biologically-plausible models and results into functional learning rules suitable for large network simulations. I studied functional development in spiking neural networks during my PhD at the University of Edinburgh under supervision of Matthias Hennig.</em><br><br>

<strong>Quantum Machine Learning: Benchmark and Application</strong>
<br>
Quantum machine learning (QML) is an active research area exploring quantum-enhanced solutions for real-world problems. While quantum advantages have shown promise, they remain difficult to generalize, particularly in ML. A key foundation for demonstrating such advantages is the theory of quantum kernels. In this talk, I cover a detailed analysis of the quantum kernel approach, leveraging feature maps and relevant hyperparameters to develop quantum-enhanced ML models. This included presenting a novel high-order feature map and a comparative evaluation of distinct SOTA feature maps on distinct benchmark datasets for classification tasks. Additionally, the importance of hyperparameter tuning is emphasized, as it improves performance by capturing complex data patterns and enabling superior decision boundaries. Furthermore, the designed QML model is extended to brain data analysis. I introduce SNN-QC, a novel hybrid computational framework combining neuro-inspired information processing using SNNs and quantum kernels for quantum information processing. SNN-QC, as proof of concept, is demonstrated on a smaller EEG dataset to classify wrist movement tasks, emphasising the advantages of the proposed feature map. SNN-QC applicability is demonstrated on quantum hardware using both a superconducting IBM QPU and a high-fidelity noisy simulation, along with a noise analysis. The results show that SNN-QC, as a proof of concept, provides a potential pathway toward developing quantum-enhanced models for a broader class of spatio-temporal problems.

<strong>Health Monitoring and Drift Detection of Cryogenic Pumps for Smart Semiconductor Manufacturing</strong>
<br>
Semiconductor manufacturing involves several critical steps, wherein maintaining an ultra-high vacuum is essential. In industry, this environment is typically achieved using cryogenic pumps. Due to operational loads and material aging, the health of pumps starts deteriorating over time. A sudden vacuum malfunction can lead to processing chamber contamination and disrupt production. However, a prognostics and health management (PHM) framework can be utilized to enhance system safety and reliability through continuous health monitoring, drift detection and accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL). For health degradation or drift detection, densities of reference and test windows are calculated to find dissimilarity score using direct density ratio estimation (DDRE). Moreover, DDRE-based change score is used for distinguishing steady drift and progressive or runway failure. Additionally, to validate the effectiveness of the DDRE algorithm, experiments have been conducted using publicly available rolling bearing datasets.

<strong>Taking human wellbeing seriously in an AI summer</strong>
<br>
In this talk, I will discuss my background and the various research activities I have been involved in, including digital health/wellbeing, clinical decision making, eye tracking, HCI, applied AI/machine learning and health data analytics. However, I will likely relfect on the basics of AI and humanity which I think are important. This includes considering what human wellbeing is and whether AI can help or hinder human flourishing/eudaimonia. This may include considering the self-determination theory, Maslow's hierarchy and a positive psychology model called PERMA. I am not an expert on these theories, but it is important for computer scientists to perhaps take a wellbeing centric approach when building digital technologies and assess their impact on human flourishing.</p>

<strong>Trustworthy and Explainable AI in Healthcare: Recent Advances and Research Frontiers</strong>
<br>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the healthcare ecosystem by enabling intelligent, data-driven, and autonomous systems that support clinical decision-making, diagnosis, and treatment planning. However, most machine learning and deep learning models function as <em>black boxes</em>, providing little insight into how conclusions are drawn.  Thus, the critical limitation of today's intelligent systems is their inability to explain their decisions and actions to human users. This limitation poses a significant challenge, especially in risk-sensitive healthcare applications such as disease prediction, patient monitoring, and clinical decision support. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a promising solution to address this limitation, providing interpretability and building trust in AI-driven systems. This seminar will present recent advancements in trustworthy and explainable AI for healthcare, highlighting how XAI methods enhance reliability, accountability, and ethical use of AI through selected real-world use cases.</p>

Laura Grima is a Research Scientist in the Dudman Lab at the Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia. Prior to this position, she completed both a Master’s and DPhil (PhD) at the University of Oxford, with her PhD focusing on the role of mesolimbic dopamine and activity at striatal receptor subtypes on goal-directed action. She became interested in foraging behaviours during a brief postdoctoral position in Oxford, where she found that slow changes in ventral striatal dopamine levels reflected environment quality in trained mice making decisions in a novel operant chamber-based foraging task. In 2019 she moved to Janelia to study the role of dopamine in naïve mice making foraging decisions in large spatial environments.</em><br>
<p align="justify">
<strong>Dynamics of learning in many option foraging</strong>
<br>
In natural environments, animals must effectively allocate their choices across many concurrently available resources when foraging. This is a complex decision-making process not fully captured by existing models. In this talk I will describe a novel paradigm that we developed, in which untrained, water-restricted mice were free to sample from six options rewarded at a range of deterministic intervals and positioned around the walls of a large (~2m) arena. Mice exhibited rapid learning, matching their choices to integrated reward ratios across six options within the first session. To develop a mechanistic description of this learning, we constructed an reinforcement learning model inspired by foraging theory. In combination with a dynamic, global (across all options) learning rate, this model was able to accurately reproduce mouse learning and decision-making. Finally, I will discuss results of fiber photometry recordings in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS). We found that NAcC, but not DMS, dopamine more closely reflected this global learning rate than local error-based updating. Altogether, our results provide insight into the neural substrate of a learning algorithm that allows mice to rapidly exploit multiple options when learning to forage in large spatial environments.</p>
