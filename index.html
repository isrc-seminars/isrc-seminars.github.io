<strong>Spiking Neural Networks for Detecting Denial-of-Service Attacks in Networks-on-Chip</strong>
<br>
Modern computing systems consist of numerous computing cores, necessitating fast and accurate inter-core communication to maintain high performance. Networks-on-Chip (NoC), inspired by packet-switched computer networks, have emerged as a reliable communication paradigm for on-chip components. However, NoCs are vulnerable to various security threats, including spoofing, side-channel attacks, eavesdropping, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, which can significantly degrade device performance. While some circuit modifications can be identified during the design phase, no universal detection approach exists. Detecting these attacks within the NoC is crucial to prevent disruptions in critical functionality. This research explores the advancements and challenges in NoC architectures, with a focus on implementing third-generation Artificial Spiking Neural Network-based systems (SNNs) for the detection of DoS attacks in NoCs.</p>

<strong>Fault Detection in Microprocessors (RISC-V) using Spiking Neural Networks</strong>
<br>
Reliability of microprocessors used in safety critical applications such as space exploration is vital and mechanisms are required to ensure execution safety during runtime. These mechanisms must be carefully evaluated to avoid adding overheads to the design, e.g. increased power consumption and area utilisation. This talk presents a novel and brain-inspired technique that utilises Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as classifiers to detect hardware faults which affect the microprocessors architecture.</p>

<strong> A Novel Squeezing Technique for Noise Reduction in Association Matrices</strong>
<br>
We introduce a novel technique, termed squeezing, designed to manipulate noisy data for improved estimation of association matrices, including correlation, covariance, similarity, and distance matrices. Squeezing parametrizes statistical distributional alignment to vectorize co-movement noise, enabling a more robust and objective-specific determination of the covariance matrix. Our model-free approach facilitates a more comprehensive exploration of the eigenspace of the estimated matrix. While introduced in the context of investment portfolio optimization, the technique is broadly applicable across a range of machine learning paradigms where accurate matrix estimation is critical. Empirical results demonstrate that squeezing outperforms industry-standard methods for addressing noise in financial covariance matrices.</p>

<strong> Evolutionary Strategies for Design of Engineered Systems</strong>
<br>
This presentation will put forth several straightforward but successful implementations of an often-overlooked evolutionary algorithm - evolutionary strategies, ES - for the design of complex systems.  ES was developed more than 50 years ago for optimizing engineering design problems in continuous space and is characterized by its simplicity and computational efficiency.  There are few tunable parameters in the basic version and the search relies on the evolution of a population through mutation only, where mutation is a Gaussian which adapts automatically to the search history.  Such simplicity is appealing for both algorithm development and implementation and tends to result in a robust search.  The three engineering design problems showcased in this talk are diverse and two of them are bi-objective optimized to identify a Pareto set of non-dominated designs.  The applications are (1) the design of an airfoil for a flying drone considering drag and lift, (2) the location of semi-obnoxious facilities in municipalities considering transport costs and social costs, and (3) the design of large order picking warehouses considering travel distance.</p>
<strong>Brief Overview of Women Led Research in Computational Intelligence</strong>

<strong>Transferable Brain-Computer Interfacing based Status Monitoring System to Augment Motor Imagery based Neurorehabilitation</strong>
<br>
Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) have shown promising results in supporting neurorehabilitation, particularly for individuals recovering from motor impairments. However, prolonged use of MI-BCIs can lead to mental fatigue, which significantly affects user engagement and system performance. In this project, we are developing a Transferable Brain-Computer Interfacing based Status Monitoring System, designed to continuously assess the mental fatigue levels of users during MI-based neurorehabilitation sessions. The system employs non-invasive M/EEG recordings and leverages domain-adaptable machine learning techniques to detect neural signatures of mental fatigue in real-time, ensuring robustness across individual variability and session-wise shifts. By integrating fatigue monitoring into the BCI loop, the proposed framework enables dynamic adaptation of task difficulty and/or rest periods to maintain optimal user performance and comfort. This closed-loop system has the potential to enhance the efficacy of MI-based neurorehabilitation by sustaining user engagement, personalizing therapy, and preventing cognitive overload.</p>

<strong>Model- and Data-Driven Decision Support for Complex Engineering Systems</strong>
<br>
This presentation introduces a decision support framework for fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance in complex engineering systems. The research objective is to integrate physics-based modelling with data-driven learning to monitor system health, detect faults early, and estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of critical components. The framework employs advanced signal and image processing techniques to extract meaningful patterns from sensor data. These features are further refined using evolutionary algorithms and information theory-based optimisation to enhance the precision of diagnostic decisions. For RUL forecasting, a statistical learning-based prognostic model-built on Bayesian inference and empirical degradation modelling-provides probabilistic predictions while accounting for uncertainties in operational data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through case studies involving a micro-nano fabrication cleanroom air treatment system, rotating machinery, and semiconductor wafer defect recognition.</p>

<strong>Security of Approximate Neural Networks against Power Side-channel Attacks</strong>
<br>
Emerging low-energy computing technologies, in particular approximate computing, are becoming increasingly relevant in key applications. A significant use case for these technologies is reduced energy consumption in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), an increasingly pressing concern with the rapid growth of AI deployments. It is essential we understand the security implications of approximate computing in an ANN context before this practice becomes commonplace. In this work, we examine the test case of approximate ANN processing elements (PE) in terms of information leakage via the power side channel. We perform a weight extraction correlation Power Analysis (CPA) attack under three approximation scenarios: overclocking, voltage scaling, and circuit level bitwise approximation. We demonstrate that as the degree of approximation increases the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of power traces rapidly degrades. We show that the Measurement to Disclosure (MTD) increases for all approximate techniques. An MTD of 48 under precise computing is increased to at minimum 200 (bitwise approximate circuit at 25% approximation), and under some approximation scenarios >1024. i.e. an increase in attack difficulty of at least x4 and potentially over x20. A relative Security-Power-Delay (SPD) analysis reveals that, in addition to the across the board improvement vs precise computing, voltage and clock scaling both significantly outperform approximate circuits with voltage scaling as the highest performing technique.</p>

<strong>Digital Twin of a Vehicular Engine as a Simulation Environment Platform for Fault Diagnosis</strong>
<br>
Fault diagnosis in highly nonlinear dynamic systems, such as vehicle engines, has garnered significant attention, particularly with the automotive industry's shift towards autonomous driving technologies. This seminar presents a comprehensive model-based digital twin testbed of a turbocharged spark-ignited (TCSI) petrol engine system for testing and evaluating residuals generation and fault diagnosis methods. Developed using Matlab/Simulink, the testbed provides a user-friendly graphical interface to simulate engine behavior and to visualize engine telemetries under various industrial-standard driving cycles, including the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), Extra-Urban Driving Cycle (EUDC), and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Federal Test Procedure (FTP75).
<br><br>
The Interface allows the designer to Induce one of eleven specific faults, facilitating a deeper understanding of their impact on engine performance without risking permanent damage or reduced engine lifespan. This simulation testbed offers an invaluable platform for researchers and automotive engineers to generate essential data, fostering the development and comparison of current and emerging fault diagnosis methodologies for automotive engine systems.

<strong>AI, healthcare and geography: understanding lung cancer risk factors beyond smoking.</strong>
<br>
After a brief overview of my work with individual based models for bacterial biofilm formation, I will give a short introduction to the <strong>LUCIA</strong> - <strong>LU</strong>ng <strong>C</strong>ancer-related risk factors and their <strong>I</strong>mpact <strong>A</strong>ssessment - project. Lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Early detection is paramount to improve patient outcomes, but current lung cancer screening is costly and underdeveloped. Similarly, while the link between developing lung cancer and smoking is well established, the contribution of other factors such as indoor and outdoor pollution, co-morbidities, genetics and biological pathways is under-researched. The talk will discuss the role of explainable <strong>GeoAI</strong> (AI models that use geospatial data and output geospatial predictions) in healthcare research, the current limitations of GeoAI techniques and future research directions. The link between environmental and socio-economic conditions and lung cancer incidence will be highlighted, using examples from literature and preliminary results from the LUCIA project. </p>

<strong>A Pilot Study on the User Experience of Different Upper Body Extended Reality Physiotherapy Interventions.</strong>
<br>
The implementation of Extended Reality (XR) technology into physiotherapy settings has shown promising outcomes across various patient groups, with user experience playing a key role in determining how well these approaches are accepted in both home and clinical settings. This presentation will explore how XR physiotherapy interventions impact user experience. Six participants took part in a study with three stages. In Stage 1, participants watched a physiotherapy video on a computer, while Stages 2 and 3 used a Meta Quest 3 headset, with Stage 2 introducing ghosting as an additional guide, and Stage 3 adding both visual and auditory feedback after exercises. Data was collected using questionnaires and interviews to measure user experience and mental workload, showing stage 3 had the highest mental workload and the most satisfaction. Participants preferred the XR stages for better focus and enjoyment, highlighting XR's potential to improve engagement in physiotherapy.</p>

<em>Carsen Stringer is a group leader at HHMI Janelia Research Campus. Our lab records from populations of ~50,000 neurons simultaneously using two-photon calcium imaging. We use machine learning techniques to investigate the structure of the recorded activity, either in response to external stimuli such as virtual reality, or in response to the animal's own actions.</em><br>

<strong>Unsupervised pretraining in biological neural networks</strong>
<br>
Representation learning in neural networks may be implemented with supervised or unsupervised algorithms, distinguished by the availability of feedback. In sensory cortex, perceptual learning drives neural plasticity, but it is not known if this is due to supervised or unsupervised learning. Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVA), while mice learned multiple tasks as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli. Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioral learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was concentrated in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning. Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction which we validated with behavioral experiments.</p>
