<em>I am a PostDoctoral researcher in the group of Melanie Stefan at Medical School Berlin working on computational models of synaptic plasticity. My research interest is focused on the biological processes of learning. I hope to elucidate the role of temporal-spatial signalling of the various actors within the plasticity cascades in health and disease. My approach uses multi-scale models including biochemical reaction system and electrophysiology in order to translate the highly detailed biologically-plausible models and results into functional learning rules suitable for large network simulations. I studied functional development in spiking neural networks during my PhD at the University of Edinburgh under supervision of Matthias Hennig.</em><br><br>
<strong>From behaviour to proteins: Modelling learning at different scales</strong>
<br>
In this talk, I am going to give an overview of my research. It starts at the behavioural comparison between DNNs and human object detection up to my most recent projects focused on protein synthesis.</p>
<em>In-person seminar.</em>
